## How to modify & install theme

There's an [official guide](http://telegra.ph/Create-Telegram-Theme-01-12) how to make themes

1) Edit colors.tdesktop-theme file.  
2) Change background (if you want). Tiled backgrounds should be named `tiled.png` or `tiled.jpg` while normal backgrounds should be names as `background.png` or `background.jpg`.  
3) Use `build.py` to pack the themes.
4) Go to Settings > Chat Settings > Chat Background (Choose from file), and choose the file that already built.
